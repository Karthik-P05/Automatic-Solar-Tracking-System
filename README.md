# Automatic-Solar-Tracking-System

The automatic solar tracking system have a rotating solar panel that makes it different from
conventional solar power generation system. The main components in automatic system is the
light sensor (LDR), the servo motor and Arduino UNO. The LDRâ€™s are on the both sides of
panel. When the sun rises the LDR senses the light intensity and gives the data to the Arduino.
Then the Arduino works as per the pre-installed program and then that is passed to servo
motor. The servo motor rotates the solar panel to certain angle with the help of information
from Arduino. Further process are same as that of conventional solar power generation system.
These rotating panel helps to get maximum intensity light thorough the day and thus the
efficiency in producing electrical energy is much more than the conventional system. The
implementation is little tough but it can be placed anywhere in the surface to have maximum
output.
